Initial release: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/711011022.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11041233)  For the most up to date respository please navigate to [NeurovascularDynamics](https://github.com/JDuckworth1/NeurovascularDynamics). Please direct quesitons to Jacob Duckworth at jaduckwo@ucsd.edu. 

Some files in this repository use functions from the [chronux toolbox](http://chronux.org) and/or functions developed by Xiang Ji: [VCRA](https://github.com/xiangjiph/VCRA)

## Wide-field
Extract and save dF/F (x,t) from tif images. Compute the peak vasomotor frequency, preform space-frequency SVD, and plot the dominant mode's magnitude and phase. Extract phase at each location along the vasculature, calculate phase gradients and traveling wave properties.

## Penetrating Ves
Process interleaved two photon frame scan tif images. Estimate cross sectional diameter using the [Threshold in Radon space method](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1038/jcbfm.2014.67), and perform spectral calculations on the resulting diameter time series. Calculate spectra, phase, and coherence for each trial and plot these results.

## Pial2P
Process and analyze two photon frame scans with two simultaneous imaging channels: Cy5.5 and smooth muscle GCaMP. Calculate GCaMP dF/F(x,t), integrated Cy5.5 intensity(x,t), and lumen diameter(x,t) via Full-Width-(Scale factor)-Max. Analyze these signals using cross correlation and spectral methods.

## RBCFlux
Process two photon line scan images with two simultaneous imaging channels: Cy5.5 annd RBCs labeled with CellTrace CFSE. Detect and count RBCs, and calculate vessel diameter using FWHM. Compute flux and diameter as a function of time.

## Statistics
Helper functions for various calculations. Perform regression through the origin and calculate the associated uncertainty in slope using bootstrap methods. Perform [line subtraction](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/13/4/717/6503/Sampling-Properties-of-the-Spectrum-and-Coherency) to detect and remove sinusoidal components from complex timeseries data.

## VesGraph
Functions required to compute the vessel graph (nodes and links) from the pial vasculature mask. Written by Xiang Ji: [VCRA](https://github.com/xiangjiph/VCRA)
